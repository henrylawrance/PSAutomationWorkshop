# PowerShell Automation Workshop

The files in this repository are teaching material for my PowerShell Automation Workshop
delivered at the PowerShell Saturday pre-conference in Chattanooga, TN in August 2018.

All PowerShell scripts and code samples are offered "as-is" and are intended to be used for
educational purposes. There is no guarantee that all code examples will work properly, or work
properly in your environment.

_Nothing in this repository is intended to be used as written in a production environment._
